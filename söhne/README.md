<br />
The starting point for Söhne was not the Regular style but the “Halbfett”, or Semibold. It makes sense: we’re all familiar with the famous New York subway signage system or iconic works by Josef Müller-Brockmann. As Sowersby points out in his detailed description: “When I think of Akzidenz-Grotesk used by the modernists, it’s only two weights: Halbfett and Fett”. He had no shortage of inspirational sources to work with, since the original typeface was sold by several type foundries under different names, sometimes with slightly adjusted lettershapes. This is reflected in two alternative forms of a and g.
